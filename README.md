- **Therapy Plan Documentation:** Therapists can create and maintain therapy plans, setting goals and listing activities.
- **Supervisor Review:** Supervisors review submitted therapy plans and provide constructive input.
- **Progress Reports:** Therapists generate progress reports after completing at least ten therapy sessions.
- **Evaluation and Feedback:** Supervisors assess progress reports and offer detailed feedback.
- **Clinical Ratings:** Supervisors provide clinical ratings based on the overall handling and quality of therapy sessions.
- **Continuous Improvement:** The system supports ongoing management of therapy cases until completion or discontinuation.
